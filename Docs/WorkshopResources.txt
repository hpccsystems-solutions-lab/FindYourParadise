The Storm Events Database contains the records used to create the official NOAA Storm Data publication, documenting:   
The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, 
significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce;
Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area; and
Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event.
The database currently contains data from January 1950 to October 2022, as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).
